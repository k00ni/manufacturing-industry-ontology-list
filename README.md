# Working repository: List of industry ontologies

## TODOs

* [ ] Remove obsolete entries from paper.bib
* [ ] Mention Graphviz config + image somewhere in the documentation (and paper)
* [ ] add short info how to use PHP scripts
* [ ] small RDF file which models connections between ontologies/vocabularies?
* [ ] Possible statistics:
  * [x] Amount of each license used
  * [x] Number of entries with/without "Information not available"
  * [ ] Number of entries with update in last 3 and 7 years

## Misc

File [yuml-diagram-config.txt](./yuml-diagram-config.txt) contains config code for graph visualization (yuml.me).
It is generated via `make` command.
Insert it here to generate a visualization: https://yuml.me/diagram/scruffy/class/draw
