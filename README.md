# Working repository: List of industry ontologies

## TODOs

* [ ] Remove KIF related content, because its more clear when there is only RDF (e.g. ontology relations)
* [ ] Create at least 1 image which shows ALL ontologies and their relation
* [ ] Remove obsolete entries from paper.bib
* [ ] Mention Graphviz config + image somewhere in the documentation (and paper)
* [ ] Possible statistics:
  * [ ] Number of owl Imports + Namespaces checked
  * [ ] Amount of each license used
  * [ ] Amount of entries with/without abbreviation

* [ ] check http://www.ebusiness-unibw.org/ontologies/opdm/

## Misc

File [yuml-diagram-config.txt](./yuml-diagram-config.txt) contains config code for graph visualization (yuml.me).
It is generated via `make` command.
Insert it here to generate a visualization: https://yuml.me/diagram/scruffy/class/draw
