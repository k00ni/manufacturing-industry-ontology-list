# Working repository: List of industry ontologies

## TODOs

* [ ] add helper script to check if all files/project sites are still up
  * https://stackoverflow.com/a/73975832
* [ ] fill up empt description fields in broken-links-..
* [ ] if possible link all available RDF files
  * TODO and above for SEAS https://w3id.org/seas/TradingOntology-1.1.rdf
* [ ] build list of all problematic ontology IRIs to see if there is something left to cover
* [ ] Remove KIF related content, because its more clear when there is only RDF (e.g. ontology relations)
* [ ] Create at least 1 image which shows ALL ontologies and their relation
* [ ] Remove obsolete entries from paper.bib
* [ ] Mention Graphviz config + image somewhere in the documentation (and paper)
* [ ] Possible statistics:
  * [ ] Number of owl Imports + Namespaces checked
  * [ ] Amount of each license used
  * [ ] Amount of entries with/without abbreviation
