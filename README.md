# List of manufacturing industry ontologies in RDF

This repository contains a list of publicly available, manufacturing industry RDF-ontologies. Further additions and changes are welcome.

## Briefly about the history

My findings during a systematic literature-, software- and internet study about publicly available, manufacturing industry RDF-ontologies were documented in the raw files you find here.
The research took place in 2024 and the list doesn't claim to be complete.
All results of that research were published in the following paper:

## Content of this repository

### ontologies.csv

The file [**ontologies.csv**](./ontologies.csv) contains an overview of all OWL-ontologies found during the survey.
Each entry contains information (if available) such as title, short description, latest activity and RDF-data.

### broken-links-redirects.csv

The file [broken-links-redirects.csv](./broken-links-redirects.csv) contains a list of URLs known to be invalid or superfluous.
For each URL there is a short info, why it is part of the list.

### scripts

PHP scripts were developed and used to aid the survey.
Further information can be found in [scripts](./scripts/)
